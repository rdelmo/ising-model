---
The following parts looks into:

(a) Definition of a two-state system
(b) Implementation and running a simulation of the 2D ferromagnetic Ising model using the Metropolisâ€“Hastings algorithm.
(c) the effect of an external field on the 1D model
(d) the effect on the 2D model
(e) exploration of the 3D Ising model
